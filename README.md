The 7 layers of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model are: 

Physical layer:

Protocols: Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, USB
Services: Bit synchronization, Physical addressing, Line coding, Modulation, Multiplexing
Relevant information: Specifies the physical characteristics of the transmission medium, such as the cable types, connectors, and signal encoding.

Data link layer:

Protocols: Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP), High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC)
Services: Error detection and correction, Flow control, Access control, Framing
Relevant information: Defines how data is transmitted between devices on a local network, including the format of the data frames, how they are addressed, and how errors are detected and corrected.

Network layer:

Protocols: Internet Protocol (IP), Routing Information Protocol (RIP), Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
Services: Logical addressing, Routing, Congestion control, Fragmentation and reassembly
Relevant information: Responsible for routing data packets across different networks based on their logical addresses, and for managing network congestion to ensure efficient use of network resources.

Transport layer:

Protocols: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
Services: Reliable data delivery, Error recovery, Flow control, Congestion control
Relevant information: Provides end-to-end communication services between applications running on different devices, including error detection and recovery, and flow control to avoid overwhelming the receiver with too much data.

Session layer:

Protocols: Remote Procedure Call (RPC), Network File System (NFS)
Services: Session establishment, Data exchange, Session termination
Relevant information: Manages the establishment, maintenance, and termination of sessions between applications, including authentication and security features to protect data during transmission.

Presentation layer:

Protocols: Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), Transport Layer Security (TLS)
Services: Data translation, Data encryption, Data compression
Relevant information: Formats and presents data in a way that can be easily understood by applications, including encryption and compression to protect the data and improve performance.

Application layer:

Protocols: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Domain Name System (DNS)
Services: Network services for applications, including email, web browsing, file transfer, and directory services
Relevant information: Provides services and protocols for end-user applications, including email, file transfer, and web browsing, as well as support for network management and monitoring.
